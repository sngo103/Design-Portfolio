In this repo are my designs from the past. I'm interested in going into UI/UX design, but haven't had much formal experience in that field. However, I've always been interested in design concepts and had a strong attention to detail. If I were given the right opportunity, I would be able to be just as successful, if not more, than those who have had previous UI/UX experience. 

### Included in this folder:
1. Posters for Stuyvesant High School student events that were used to advertise from when I was the Grassroots Marketing Director for my Student Union Sophomore and Junior Caucus
2. Layout design pages for the Indicator school yearbook from when I was Layout Head Editor
